# EquiLearn Adventure
A two-person, split-screen maze game where players would encounter random events and need to make choice to balance time and resources

## Mechanism
There are random-scattered objects (box and books) in the map. The box have two type, either a timer object that can increase/decrease the player time, or a exam object that would decrease the player's knowledge. The book object would increase the player's knowledge. All these values are randomly assigned. If the player's knowledge exceed the maximum capacity or becomes a negative value, then the player would overload.
